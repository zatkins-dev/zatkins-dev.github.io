abstract: As photovoltaic (PV) penetration continues to rise and smart inverter functionality
  continues to expand, smart inverters and other distributed energy resources (DERs)
  will play increasingly important roles in distribution system power management and
  security. In this paper, it is demonstrated that a constellation of smart inverters
  in a simulated distribution circuit can enable precise voltage predictions using
  an asynchronous and decentralized prediction algorithm. Using simulated data and
  a constellation of 15 inverters in a ring communication topology, the Cola algorithm
  is shown to accomplish the learning task required for voltage magnitude prediction
  with far less communication overhead than fully connected P2P learning protocols.
  Additionally, a dynamic stopping criterion is proposed that does not require a regularizer
  like the original Cola stopping criterion.
