      text: |-
        I'm a graduate research assistant focusing on performance, scalability, efficiency, and accuracy for simulations of complex physical systems.
        I contribute to open-source and publicly funded software packages for numerical linear algebra, partial differential equations, and computational mechanics.

        My particular interests include finite-element-based implicit contact mechanics and implicit material point methods.
