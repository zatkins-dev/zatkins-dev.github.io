abstract: Modern computing includes platforms which are inherently unreliable or extremely
  heterogenous, e.g., multi-agent systems, which require asynchronous or decentralized
  methods that can handle various unreliability conditions such as device failures,
  communication delays, or data unreliability. Collaborative autonomy is an emerging
  class of numerical methods that provide reliable computations in unreliable computing
  environments. This minisymposium brings together researchers to present state of
  the art methods within collaborative autonomy that ensure robustness in decentralized
  and asynchronous computing. To this end, it will focus on implementation challenges
  and algorithmic developments of robust numerical linear algebra methods for current
  and future unreliable computing environments.
